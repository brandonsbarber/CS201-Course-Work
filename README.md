SimCity201 README
======

Project repository for the SimCity201 project completed by Brandon Barber, Ben Doherty, Matthew Pohlmann, and Skyler Lloyd as a final project for CSCI201 - Principles of Software Development.

####Compilation Instructions
To compile and run SimCity201:
  + Clone the most recent tag (should be V2.X) into a folder
  + In Eclipse, File -> New -> Java Project
  + Uncheck `Use default location`
  + Click `Browse` and select the repository you downloaded
  + Ensure that `Java SE 7` is selected under JRE
  + Click `Finish`
  + Eclipse will give some errors from the JUnit testing section because JUnit4 is not included in the build path
  + With the current project open, Project -> Properties -> Libraries -> Add Library...
  + Select `JUnit`
  + Click `Next`
  + Under `JUnit library version` select `JUnit 4`
  + Click `Finish`

###Things That Don't Work
 + No File I/O for configuration
 + No GUI for dynamic configuration of buildings
 + No working Bank
 + Slightly buggy Pedestrian/Vehicle collisions
 + Animation in the CityView is extremely slow and buggy because Java can't handle so many draw calls
 + Some large scenarios don't work because we simply did not have the time or resources to integrate everything with only 4 people
 + Skyler's restaurant is incomplete (shifts don't quite work, no rotating stand, no cook animation)
